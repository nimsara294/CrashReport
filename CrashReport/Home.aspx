                    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; color:white; text-align:center;">From lane departure warnings to automatic emergency braking, drivers 
                        today have more technology than ever to help avoid car accidents. But with more cars on the road, the number of 
                        traffic fatalities continues to rise, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
                        Taking a scientific approach to what causes car accidents can help us better understand – and potentially 
                        avoid – them in the future.<br />
                        To a driver, getting into an accident may feel like a stroke of bad luck – a matter of being in the wrong 
                        place at the wrong time, perhaps. There’s some truth to the idea of timing. It’s generally safer to drive during 
                        daylight hours instead of nighttime, when visibility is lower and other drivers are likely to be fatigued, 
                        or perhaps driving under the influence, for example. While there’s an element of chance in an accident, 
                        often it’s due to a series of connected events that can be deciphered to discover the root cause of the crash. 
                        It can mean that a small mistake, when compounded with another factor, can lead to a serious car accident. 
                        But safe drivers who are prepared to react to that root cause can help prevent a more serious accident than drivers 
                        who are not prepared. Safe driving is more than simply driving the speed limit; it’s about anticipating other 
                        driver’s actions and recognizing when a curve in the road ahead or inclement weather requires drivers to slow down.﻿﻿<br />
